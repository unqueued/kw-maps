### Kane's Wrath Custom Maps by erlNite (past erl115/Kirasaitru)

#### Update 2019: From now on I'm only going to upload new maps at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/erlNite) site, so you will need to Subscribe to get a hold of my new maps. I will not edit or create new maps for the public any longer. You can still download and play my older maps published here of course :)

At this site you'll find all my past KW custom maps to download, edit or play in-game/multiplayer. Some few of the maps (the tank missions mostly) are created from original maps by other map makers which are credited in the intro of the map.

Be aware that a few of my maps (especially recent ones) may have some desync issues when played online (because they were not tested enough). If encountered, to solve this you must play the map solo in Skirmish mode. In other words, playing a map in solo/singleplayer mode will not cause any desyncs.
Desyncs (and bugs generally) are the worst aspect of C&C3 Kane's Wrath Online, these are hard to detect when playing solo, and some times hard, but mostly time consuming to fix. Most of my maps (especially the most poular ones) does not have any desync issues, because they have been tested with online players.

If my maps are edited, please give me some credits, thank you.
For people who want to edit or create a new custom map, take a look in the Worldbuilder section. Tutorial link can be found below.


INSTALLATION OF A CUSTOM MAP:

To install a custom map, unzip/extract and paste the map folder into the correct path in Windows:
"USER/appdata/roaming/C&C Kanes Wrath/Maps"
The "appdata" folder can be entered by tapping windows button, or Win+R, and type %appdata% - Hit enter.


HOW TO DOWNLOAD A MAP:

To download a map, just browse the directories and click on the map you want to download. It should appear a "Download" button. You can also just "Clone/Download" the whole project with all the Worlbuilder files and maps included, click the "clone or download" button in the upper right area of the project main page. Or you can go to releases and download the latest released map pack.
